# Gummy Revived
## A revival of the amazing (but now defunct) Gummy theme by Kneecaps

This is a attempt at reviving the Gummy Theme, which focuses on a clean design language, celebrating minimalism.

Gummy doesn't have any style settings (Atleast, not yet!) but the UI elements respond to your currently applied accent colour. The beautiful gradients are sure to keep you interested and mesmerized.

Gummy, by default, uses **Peace Sans** for the titles and **Space Grotesk** for the main text. 

It also works well with plugins such as Make.md, Kanban, Omnisearch, Better Command Palette, Influx, Strange New Worlds, Reminder, Memo, and Surfing. Want to see it on a website? [Sure!](https://winnerwind.github.io)

# Credits
Credit where credit is due, this theme is NOT made by me. This is made by [Kneecaps](https://github.com/7368697661), however due to recent inactivity on this theme, it was necessary for me to maintain it.
[Peace Sans](https://www.behance.net/gallery/34760019/Peace-Sans-FREE-FONT) is by Sergey Raydovoy and Ivan Gladkikh. Without it, this theme would look awkward.
[Space Grotesk](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Grotesk) is by Florian Karsten.

# Lets do this, together.
Just like the message behind the original Gummy, I want to celebrate Obsidian's sleek and modern design along with the community. If you wish to contribute, contribute! Feel free to [Contact me](https://winnerwind.github.io/contact.html) or submit an issue on Github.
